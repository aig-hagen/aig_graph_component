The [graph-custom-element.js](graph-custom-element.js) file in this directory is a **custom element** of the graph component. 
It allows you to embed the graph component using the HTML tag <code><graph-component/></code> as seen in the [index.html](index.html) file.

This is what you also would get as an output in the dist-directory after executing <code>nuxt generate</code>.
