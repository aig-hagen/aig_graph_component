The [graph-custom-element.js](graph-custom-element.js) file in this directory is a **custom element** of the graph component. 
It allows you to embed the graph component using the HTML tag `<graph-component>` as seen in the [index.html](index.html) file.

If you want to **change the initial settings**, you can do so by changing the `GraphConfig` in [graph-config.js](graph-config.js).

*This content is what you also would get as an output in the dist-directory after executing `npm run generate`.*
